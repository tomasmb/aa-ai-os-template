# pack: company-meetings

> Handle meeting prep + meeting notes. Works with anything the user pastes
> (Zoom / Google Meet transcripts, read.ai summaries, Otter, hand-written
> notes). Also designed to auto-ingest read.ai notes when an integration ships.

## When this pack activates

Any of these triggers:

- User says *"I have a meeting with X tomorrow"* / *"help me prep for…"*
- User pastes text that looks like a meeting summary (names + timestamps +
  action items).
- User says *"here are my notes from the <topic> meeting"*.
- (Future) A read.ai note lands in `memory/meetings/` via integration.

## Prep flow (before the meeting)

When user asks to prep for a meeting:

1. Pull every recent mention of the attendees from `memory/relationships.md`
   and Notion. Summarize: *"Last time you met with X (April 10), you agreed
   on Y. Z was open."*
2. Pull every recent mention of the topic. Surface 1–3 facts the user should
   recall before walking in.
3. Ask: *"Want me to draft an agenda, or are you set?"*
4. If yes → produce a 3–5 bullet agenda grounded in the context above.
5. Save prep note as `memory/meetings/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>-prep.md`.

## Ingest flow (after the meeting)

When user pastes a transcript / read.ai summary / notes:

1. **Save the raw input** to `memory/meetings/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>.md` verbatim.
   Never lose the source.
2. **Extract structured facts** into a summary block at the top of the file:
   - **Attendees** → names, matched to `memory/relationships.md`.
   - **Topics** → one line each.
   - **Decisions made** → one line each, with who decided.
   - **Action items** → `- [ ] <owner>: <action> — by <date>`.
   - **Open questions** → one line each.
   - **Mentioned projects / people / tools** → tagged inline.
3. **Auto-capture to the right memory files** (Contract §4):
   - Decisions → append to `memory/decisions.md`.
   - Attendees and what they said they'd do → update
     `memory/relationships.md`.
   - Action items owned by the user → append to today's daily note.
   - New facts/norms → `memory/learnings.md`.
4. **Auto-promote to Notion** (Contract §9) the qualifying items:
   - If a decision affects a project → promote summary to that project page's
     `## Assistant Updates` inbox.
   - If an action item is owed to another Alpha employee → promote to their
     team page's `## Assistant Updates` inbox, tagged with their name.
   - If a question is company-wide → promote to the Operating Framework
     page's `## Assistant Updates`.
   - Skip any item the user marks *"keep local"* / *"don't share"*.
5. **Confirm in one sentence:** *"Got the <topic> meeting. 3 decisions, 2
   action items for you, 1 for <person>. Promoted 2 items to <project>
   inbox."*

## Auto-ingest from read.ai (future-ready design)

Today (V1): the user pastes read.ai summary email text into chat. This pack
handles it.

Tomorrow (V1.x): when a read.ai integration lands, notes will auto-land in
`memory/meetings/` as markdown files. Detect unprocessed files at session
start and run the ingest flow on each one silently. Notify the user once:
*"I processed 3 new meetings from read.ai while you were away — here's the
30-second summary."*

Schema we expect for auto-dropped files (once integration exists):

```
memory/meetings/
  2026-04-22-prod-sync.md       ← raw read.ai summary, verbatim
  2026-04-22-prod-sync-processed.json  ← {ingested_at, promoted_to: [...]}
```

The `-processed.json` sidecar prevents reprocessing.

## What NEVER gets promoted

- Verbatim transcripts (always summarize — Contract §9).
- Personal / off-topic conversation in the meeting (trim it).
- Anything marked confidential, HR-related, or about hiring decisions —
  capture locally only; if auto-promote logic flags it, default to skip and
  log to `logs/session-log.md` for user review.

## Memory layout

```
memory/meetings/
  README.md                      ← short doc of this structure
  <date>-<slug>.md              ← one file per meeting, with structured header
  <date>-<slug>-prep.md         ← (optional) pre-meeting prep notes
```

## Configurable per user

In `WORKSTYLE.md` or `TONE.md`, the user can override:

- `meetings.promote_action_items_to_others`: default `true`. Set `false` to
  keep action items private until the user says otherwise.
- `meetings.summary_length`: `short` (default), `medium`, `full`.
- `meetings.ingest_automatically`: default `true`. Set `false` to require
  explicit *"process this meeting"*.
